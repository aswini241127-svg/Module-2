Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python
🎯 Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number 16 into its binary representation using built-in Python functions.

🧠 Algorithm
Assign the value 16 to a variable a.
Use the built-in bin() function to convert the number to binary.
Print the result.
🧾 Program
a = 16 print(bin(a))

Output
exp1
Result
The program successfully converts the number 16 into its binary representation and displays the result as 0b10000 on the screen.
